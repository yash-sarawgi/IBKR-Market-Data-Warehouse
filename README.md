# Market Data Warehouse

A local-first financial data warehouse for universe-scale market data.

The project is designed to store and analyze historical **OHLCV data across equities, options, and futures** with a path from **daily bars today to intraday data later**. It uses a **partitioned Parquet data lake** as the canonical storage layer, **DuckDB** as the fast local analytical engine for research and backtesting, and **ClickHouse** as the production-oriented warehouse for large-scale aggregation, serving, and concurrency.

The goal is to give you:

* a **high-performance local quant research environment** on Apple Silicon
* a clean **multi-asset schema** that can handle very large datasets
* a **polyglot workflow** across Python, Rust, and Node.js
* a straightforward **path to cloud production** without rebuilding the data model from scratch

In practice, this project is meant to be the foundation for:

* historical market data storage
* factor research
* backtesting
* rolling analytics like VWAP, moving averages, and cross-sectional signals
* future expansion into intraday and production-grade analytical serving

In one sentence:

**It’s a local-first, production-ready market data warehouse for serious quantitative research and analytics.**


## IB Gateway with IBC (Automated Connection Management)

IBC automates IB Gateway startup, login, reconnection, and daily restarts — making API connections robust and hands-free.

### Installation

1. Download the latest macOS release from [IBC Releases](https://github.com/IbcAlpha/IBC/releases/latest)
2. Unzip to `~/ibc-install/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/ibc-install && unzip IBCMacos-*.zip -d ~/ibc-install
   chmod +x ~/ibc-install/*.sh ~/ibc-install/scripts/*.sh
   ```
3. Copy and edit the config:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/ibc ~/ibc/logs
   cp ~/ibc-install/config.ini ~/ibc/config.ini
   ```
4. Edit `~/ibc/config.ini` — set your credentials and these key settings:
   ```ini
   IbLoginId=YOUR_IB_USERNAME
   IbPassword=YOUR_IB_PASSWORD
   TradingMode=live
   AcceptIncomingConnectionAction=accept
   ExistingSessionDetectedAction=primary
   ReloginAfterSecondFactorAuthenticationTimeout=yes
   AutoRestartTime=11:58 PM
   ColdRestartTime=07:05
   CommandServerPort=7462
   ```
5. Edit `~/ibc-install/gatewaystartmacos.sh` — set the version and paths:
   ```bash
   TWS_MAJOR_VRSN=10.44          # Match your installed Gateway version
   IBC_INI=~/ibc/config.ini
   TRADING_MODE=live
   TWOFA_TIMEOUT_ACTION=restart
   IBC_PATH=~/ibc-install
   TWS_PATH=~/Applications
   LOG_PATH=~/ibc/logs
   ```

### Starting Gateway via IBC

```bash
~/ibc-install/gatewaystartmacos.sh
```

### IBC Commands (while Gateway is running)

```bash
~/ibc-install/stop.sh              # Clean shutdown
~/ibc-install/reconnectdata.sh     # Reconnect market data (Ctrl+Alt+F)
~/ibc-install/reconnectaccount.sh  # Reconnect to IB login server (Ctrl+Alt+R)
```

### What IBC handles automatically

- Auto-login with credentials on startup
- Auto-accepts incoming API connections
- Auto-restarts Gateway daily (default 11:58 PM) without re-authentication
- Cold restart on Sundays (07:05) with full re-authentication
- Retries 2FA if you miss the IBKR Mobile alert
- Overrides existing sessions to maintain primary connection

### IBC Logs

```bash
cat ~/ibc/logs/ibc-*.txt   # Current session log
```

## Data Ingestion

### Prerequisites

Requires **IB Gateway** running on localhost via IBC (recommended) or manually. Default port: `4001`.

### Fetch Historical OHLCV

```bash
source ~/market-warehouse/.venv/bin/activate

# Mag 7 default, inception to present:
python scripts/fetch_ib_historical.py

# Specific tickers:
python scripts/fetch_ib_historical.py --tickers AAPL NVDA

# From a preset file (with cursor-based resume):
python scripts/fetch_ib_historical.py --preset presets/sp500.json

# Custom years, port, concurrency:
python scripts/fetch_ib_historical.py --years 10 --port 7497 --max-concurrent 4

# Backfill missing older data for tickers already in DB:
python scripts/fetch_ib_historical.py --preset presets/sp500.json --backfill
```

### Backfill Mode

When tickers were initially fetched with limited history (e.g., `--years 10`), use `--backfill` to fill in older data without re-fetching everything:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_ib_historical.py --preset presets/sp500.json --backfill
```

Backfill mode:
- Detects each ticker's oldest existing date in DuckDB
- Fetches only the gap from IB inception to that oldest date
- Inserts without deleting existing data (dedup via DB constraint)
- Uses a separate cursor (`cursor_backfill_{name}.json`) for independent tracking
- Skips tickers not yet in DB (use normal fetch for those first)

### Auto-Restarting Runner

For large-scale fetches across multiple presets with stall detection and auto-restart:

```bash
source ~/market-warehouse/.venv/bin/activate
bash scripts/run_backfill_all.sh
```

This script:
1. Finishes any incomplete normal fetches for sp500, ndx100, r2k
2. Runs backfill for all three presets
3. Monitors cursor file progress; restarts with cooldown if stalled
4. Gives up after 3 consecutive failures with no new completions

This populates:
- **DuckDB** `md.symbols` + `md.equities_daily`
- **Bronze Parquet** → `~/market-warehouse/data-lake/bronze/asset_class=equity/`

## Testing

All code in `clients/` and `scripts/` must have tests. Coverage is enforced at **100%** — the build fails if any line is uncovered.

```bash
source ~/market-warehouse/.venv/bin/activate

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=clients --cov=scripts --cov-report=term-missing

# Run only unit tests (skip DB integration tests)
python -m pytest tests/ -v -m "not integration"
```

### Adding new code

When adding new modules or scripts:

1. Write tests in `tests/test_<module>.py`
2. Add shared fixtures to `tests/conftest.py`
3. Mock external I/O (HTTP, file system) in unit tests
4. Use the `tmp_duckdb` fixture for DB integration tests
5. Run coverage and verify 100% before committing

Test dependencies: `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `responses`

## Project Setup
This project bootstraps a **local-first financial data warehouse** on Apple Silicon macOS.

It sets up:

* **DuckDB** for local analytics and research
* **ClickHouse** for production-style local benchmarking
* a **partitioned Parquet data lake** for canonical storage
* a Python environment with:

  * `duckdb`
  * `polars`
  * `pandas`
  * `pyarrow`
  * `clickhouse-connect`
  * `numpy`
  * `scipy`
  * `jupyterlab`

## Architecture

The intended workflow is:

* **Raw vendor data** → `data-lake/raw/`
* **Normalized canonical Parquet** → `data-lake/bronze/`
* **Cleaned / adjusted / deduped datasets** → `data-lake/silver/`
* **Derived analytics / factor tables / marts** → `data-lake/gold/`

### Local stack

* **Parquet** is the system of record
* **DuckDB** is the default local query engine
* **ClickHouse** is optional and used for warehouse-style benchmarking and production-like schema testing

```

## Requirements

* macOS
* Apple Silicon recommended
* Homebrew
* internet access for package installation

## Setup

Save the setup script as:

```bash
setup_market_warehouse.sh
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x setup_market_warehouse.sh
```

## Flags

The setup script supports these flags:

* `--start-clickhouse`
  Starts ClickHouse after setup.

* `--init-clickhouse`
  Initializes the ClickHouse schema after setup. This also implies `--start-clickhouse`.

* `--with-sample-data`
  Generates sample Parquet data under the bronze layer.

* `--smoke-test`
  Runs basic validation checks after setup.

* `--help`
  Prints usage information.

## Common commands

### Minimal install

```bash
./setup_market_warehouse.sh
```

### Install + sample data + validation

```bash
./setup_market_warehouse.sh --with-sample-data --smoke-test
```

### Install + ClickHouse startup + ClickHouse schema

```bash
./setup_market_warehouse.sh --start-clickhouse --init-clickhouse
```

### Full bootstrap

```bash
./setup_market_warehouse.sh --start-clickhouse --init-clickhouse --with-sample-data --smoke-test
```

## What the script does

The script:

1. verifies macOS / Apple Silicon assumptions
2. installs required Homebrew packages
3. installs optional Rust and Node.js tooling if missing
4. creates the warehouse directory structure
5. creates a Python virtual environment
6. installs Python dependencies
7. creates the DuckDB schema
8. writes ClickHouse schema/bootstrap files
9. writes helper scripts for ClickHouse lifecycle management
10. optionally creates sample Parquet data
11. optionally starts and initializes ClickHouse
12. optionally runs smoke tests

## Split-Adjusted Shares

All share volume stored in `md.equities_daily` reflects **split-adjusted totals**, not notional (unadjusted) shares traded on the day.

This means historical volume is retroactively scaled to be consistent with the post-split share count. For example, TSLA executed a **5-for-1 split on August 31, 2020** and a **3-for-1 split on August 25, 2022**. A bar recorded before the 2020 split with a raw volume of 4M shares would appear as 60M shares after both adjustments are applied (4M × 5 × 3).

This normalization ensures that volume comparisons across time are meaningful — you are always comparing shares on the same post-split basis rather than mixing pre- and post-split counts.

## DuckDB schema

The DuckDB bootstrap creates schema `md` with:

* `md.symbols`
* `md.equities_daily`
* `md.futures_daily`
* `md.options_daily`

Notable change:

* the options column is named **`option_right`** instead of `right` to avoid reserved keyword issues

## ClickHouse schema

The ClickHouse bootstrap creates database `md` with:

* `md.equities_daily`
* `md.futures_daily`
* `md.options_daily`

All tables use **MergeTree** and are partitioned by `toYYYYMM(trade_date)`.

## Activating Python later

The setup script creates the virtual environment, but it cannot keep your terminal activated after the script exits.

To activate it in a new shell:

```bash
source ~/market-warehouse/.venv/bin/activate
```

Or:

```bash
~/market-warehouse/scripts/activate_env.sh
```

## Helper scripts

### Start ClickHouse

```bash
~/market-warehouse/scripts/start_clickhouse.sh
```

### Initialize ClickHouse schema

```bash
~/market-warehouse/scripts/init_clickhouse.sh
```

### Stop ClickHouse

```bash
~/market-warehouse/scripts/stop_clickhouse.sh
```

## Sample data

To generate sample Parquet data manually:

```bash
python ~/market-warehouse/scripts/write_sample_parquet.py
```

This writes a small equities dataset into:

```text
~/market-warehouse/bronze/asset_class=equity/year=2025/month=01/
```

## Querying sample Parquet with DuckDB

Run:

```bash
duckdb ~/market-warehouse/duckdb/market.duckdb < ~/market-warehouse/scripts/query_parquet_duckdb.sql
```

The sample query calculates:

* average close
* total volume

grouped by `symbol_id`.

## Smoke tests

When `--smoke-test` is enabled, the script:

* checks `duckdb --version`
* checks `python --version`
* verifies Python imports for core packages
* runs the sample DuckDB query if sample data exists
* checks ClickHouse connectivity if ClickHouse was started

## Troubleshooting

### DuckDB bootstrap appears to stop after “Bootstrapping DuckDB...”

That was previously caused by loading the `httpfs` extension during bootstrap. The current script no longer does that.

### DuckDB parser error near `primary_key`

DuckDB expects:

```sql
symbol_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY
```

not:

```sql
primary_key (symbol_id)
```

### DuckDB parser error near `right`

`right` is a reserved keyword. The schema now uses:

```sql
option_right
```

### ClickHouse does not start

Try running the helper directly:

```bash
~/market-warehouse/scripts/start_clickhouse.sh
```

Then verify:

```bash
clickhouse-client --query "SELECT version()"
```

## Recommended workflow

For everyday local work:

1. keep canonical data in partitioned Parquet
2. use DuckDB for research, backtests, and local analytics
3. use ClickHouse only when you need:

   * larger-scale benchmarking
   * concurrency
   * production-like testing
   * intraday warehouse experiments

## Recommended command

```bash
./setup_market_warehouse.sh --start-clickhouse --init-clickhouse --with-sample-data --smoke-test
```
